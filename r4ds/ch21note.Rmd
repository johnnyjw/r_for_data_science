```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only `r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than 2.5 carats.  The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```

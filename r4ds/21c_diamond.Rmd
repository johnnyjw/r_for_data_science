```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only 
`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than
2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```

The peaks represent whole number sizes


```{r goulet, include = FALSE}
df <- tribble(
  ~a,
  1,
  2,
  3
)
```

And more...
```{r}
mtcars[1:5, 1:10]
```

and finally...

```{r}
knitr::kable(
  mtcars[1:5, ],
  caption = "A knitr kable."
)
```
